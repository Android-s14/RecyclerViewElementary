# RecyclerViewElementary
The final idea is to obtain a fully ready recycler view (returned programmaticaly) in one line of code.

A very initial stage of development. There are plans to leave the most basic function for constructing a fully ready recyclerview while adding different functions returning more customized recyclerviews (with custom layout managers, different data structures, custom row layouts, etc.)
